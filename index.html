    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>
        In the creation of the Lights Out Game, a deliberate design approach was taken to enhance the overall user experience and visual appeal.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Background Gradient:</strong> The background features a captivating gradient (45deg, #4CAF50, #2196F3), adding a dynamic and modern touch to the game interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Header and Footer Pattern:</strong> Consistent header and footer patterns were implemented for a structured layout, providing a unified and professional look throughout the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Target Moves:</strong> A target moves indicator was introduced to set a challenge for the players, encouraging strategic thinking and adding an additional layer of complexity to the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Grid Color:</strong> The grid utilizes a color scheme (#FFC107 for on-state and #E91E63 for off-state) that not only complements the background but also enhances visibility and interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Timer:</strong> The timer functionality was integrated seamlessly into the game, starting on the first button click and providing real-time feedback on the player's performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Grid Layout:</strong> Utilized CSS Grid to create a visually appealing 5x5 game board.</li>
        <li><strong>Button Design:</strong> Implemented buttons as grid squares with dynamic color changes to represent on/off states.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Listeners:</strong> Added click events to buttons, triggering a function to toggle square states and check for game completion.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Updates:</strong> Real-time move count updates and a winning alert provide feedback to the player.</li>  
    </ol>
      <p>
        Overcoming challenges during development involved careful consideration of timing and event handling, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
